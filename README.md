# CNN-neatness-of-student-uniforms
This project aims to classify student images based on their neatness (neat/untidy) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was developed in Google Colab using a transfer learning approach using the MobileNetV2 architecture to improve performance despite a limited dataset.
