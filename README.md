# CNN-neatness-of-student-uniforms
This project aims to classify student images based on their neatness (neat/untidy) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was developed in Google Colab using a transfer learning approach using the MobileNetV2 architecture to improve performance despite a limited dataset.

The dataset used in this project is private and not publicly available.
It consists of 510 images divided into two classes (Neat and Not Neat).
The data was split using an 80:20 ratio, where 80% was used for training and 20% for validation.
